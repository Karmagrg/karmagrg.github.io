<h1> Humans on Mars, Sooner than you think</h1>
<p>Humans are going to Mars, here’s what you need to know !

Human race will soon have a new home away from earth making us a multi-planet species and the race to Mars has already begun in earnest. Leading the race are Space X led by innovator and business man Elon Musk followed by NASA. Space X’s immensely aspirational goal of cargo mission to Mars by 2022 and the first manned mission to Mars by 2024 is commendable. While, NASA has a more conservative approach to Mars with an estimated mission date around the 2030s.

There has been a resurgence in public interest of space exploration stemming from Space X’s announcement of their Mission to Mars . Space X has since developed a successful reusable rocket technology , flown resupply missions to The International Space Station using the Falcon 9 rocket and put a fully functioning Tesla Car in orbit around the earth. No doubt this is a mammoth undertaking and delays are to be expected as even more private companies are joining the race like Jeff Bezo’s Space Origins and billionaire Paul Allen’s Stratolaunch systems Corp.

When is the flight to Mars
The Red planet is the 4th planet and the second smallest planet after mercury in our solar system. Mars has a thin atmosphere and  roughly 57million Kilometers or 35 million miles
The flight to Mars will take place when both Earth and Mars are closest to each other in their respective orbit which happens every 26 months at about a distance of about 57 million kilometers or 35 million miles. Realistically with the current technology the flight is estimated to take about 260 days or 8 months while Space X is aiming for a flight time of 3 months.
